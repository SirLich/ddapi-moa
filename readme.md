# Hammerstone DDAPI: Moa!

This mod re-implements the [Moa](https://github.com/Majic-Jungle/sapiens-mod-creation/tree/master/Examples/bin/Moa) mod created by [Majic Dave](https://github.com/Majic-Jungle).

Instead of using native modding, this mod is created using the [beta branch of Hammerstone](https://github.com/Sapiens-OSS/hammerstone-framework/tree/feature/data-driven-api), which includes a data-driven API for creating Sapiens mods.

The whole mod is more or less implemented inside of the `hammerstone` folder, which contains the configs for the DDAPI, as well as a few models/sounds.
